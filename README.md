ARSnova consists of two projects: the mobile client and the backend.
This repository contains the mobile client code.
You will find the backend at [thm-projects/arsnova-backend](https://github.com/thm-projects/arsnova-backend).
If you plan to work on the client you have to build both repositories - the backend and the client.
